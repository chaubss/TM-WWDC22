# WWDC 2022 Submission [Accepted]
This is my submission for the WWDC 2022 Swift Student Challenge. It is a simulator for a deterministic single-tape turing machine. In the app, the turing machine has examples to recognize two different languages.

- **Regular Language represented with regular expression 01*0**: Any language that can be represented as a regular expression is called a regular language. For example, 01*0 denotes a string starting and ending with a 0 and having any number of 1s in between.
- **Non-Regular Language represented as 0ⁿ1ⁿ**: A language of this form cannot be represented using regular expresssions. It can be recognized using a pushdown automata or a Turing Machine.
